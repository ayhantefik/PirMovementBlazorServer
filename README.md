<h1>PirMovementBlazorServer</h1>

The project integrates a motion system prototype that notifies users in real time when a motion is detected by an infrared sensor. Users have the option to activate sound or turn on a light in response to the motion. The time of each detected motion is recorded in a database and users can list a history of recorded movements.
